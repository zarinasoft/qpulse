        of New York, for the resolution of any such dispute. Acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement
        constitutes your consent to be sued in such courts and to accept service of process outside the State of
        California with the same force and effect as if such service had been made within the State of California. You
        hereby agree to accept service of process for any action hereunder by certified mail return receipt requested
        which service shall have the same force and effect as though service had been effected by personal service in
        the applicable jurisdiction. If any part of these terms is unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that part will be
        deemed severable and will not affect the validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions.

        of class action, exclusively by binding arbitration under the rules of the American Arbitration Association for
        full and final settlement of such Claim, and judgment on the award rendered in the arbitration may be entered in
        any court having jurisdiction thereof. Such arbitration shall be held in accordance with the Rules for Expedited
        Procedures under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association or other mutually
        agreeable organization, before a single arbitrator (with knowledge and expertise of copyright law if the claim
        is all or partially for copyright infringement), selected by agreement of both parties or by an independent
        mediator (with knowledge and expertise of copyright law if the claim is all or partially for copyright
        infringement) if the parties are unable to agree.</p>
    <p data-aos="fade-up">The parties shall split the arbitration and/or mediator costs. An award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be
        entered and confirmed by the courts of the State of California, County of San Francisco. The parties agree that
        any post-arbitration action seeking to enforce an arbitration award or action seeking equitable or injunctive
        relief shall be brought exclusively in the courts of the State of California, County of San Francisco.

        jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this
        Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed
        a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term. In addition, qpulse.co’s failure to enforce any
        term of this Agreement shall not be deemed as a waiver of such term or otherwise affect qpulse.co’s ability to
